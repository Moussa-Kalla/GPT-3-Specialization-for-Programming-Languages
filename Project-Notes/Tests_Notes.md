# Testing Steps

## 1- Define Needs and Objectives

- What types of responses or behaviors do you expect from the model?
- What kinds of data will you provide (e.g., Python tutorials, code correction, documentation)?

## 2- Criteria for Choosing a Model

- Model size: Trade-off between performance and computational cost.
- Task-specific support: Can the model handle tasks like text generation, code understanding, etc.?
- Response time: How fast should the model respond?

## 3- Collect and Prepare Data

+ Data sources:
- Official Python documentation.
- Tutorials, exercises, and code examples.
- Frequently asked questions on StackOverflow or programming forums.
+ Split the data into training and validation sets in a text or JSON file.

## 4- Format the Data for Fine-Tuning

Example: JSON format with a question-response structure.
json

{
  "prompt": "Explain this Python function:\ndef add(a, b): return a + b",
  "completion": "This function adds two numbers and returns the result."
}

## 5- Select Candidate Models (at least 4)

- Choose models based on the defined criteria.

## 6- Test a Pre-trained Model (Before Fine-Tuning)

- Load a pre-trained model to evaluate its capabilities with your prompts.
- This helps validate if the model performs well enough without fine-tuning.

## 7- Perform Exploratory Tests on a Small Dataset

- Model performance can vary depending on the type of data (e.g., some models are better at handling code, others at descriptive texts).
- Evaluate results using metrics like perplexity, exact match, or qualitative feedback (e.g., coherent responses).

## 8- Perform Fine-Tuning

- Train the model on your specific dataset to adapt it to your requirements.

## 9- Evaluate Performance

Possible metrics:
- Perplexity (PPL): Measures the statistical coherence of generated text.
- Exact match: Checks if the model's response matches the expected output.
- User testing: Provide tasks to end users to verify the relevance of the responses.
